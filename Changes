                      User-Visible Net::Duo Changes

Net::Duo 1.02 (unreleased)

    Change documentation URLs to point to duo.com instead of
    duosecurity.com, following upstream redirects.  Remove the reference
    to the Verify API, which no longer appears to be a separate API.

Net::Duo 1.01 (2015-08-16)

    Adjust for an incompatible change in JSON::XS 3.0 that broke magical
    interpretation of the strings "true" and "false" when encoding JSON.
    Use JSON::true and JSON::false instead to ensure that the JSON is
    created properly.

Net::Duo 1.00 (2014-07-11)

    Initial release with support for generic API calls (both with or
    without JSON responses) and partial implementations of the Auth and
    Admin APIs.
