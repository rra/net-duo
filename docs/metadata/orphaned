You should use the Perl code provided by Duo instead, since it will be
more up-to-date with current features.  I no longer maintain a large Duo
deployment, and my current company uses Python instead.  That said, I do
still think this package provides a nicer object framework for the Duo API
in Perl; if you agree, please feel free to adopt it and maintain it!
