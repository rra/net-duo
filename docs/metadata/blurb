Net::Duo provides an object-oriented Perl interface for the Duo Security
REST APIs.  It attempts to abstract some of the API details and provide an
object-oriented view of the returned objects in order to make use of the
API in Perl code more natural than dealing with JSON data structures
directly.  Currently, some parts of the Auth and Admin APIs are
implemented alongside with generic methods to call any of the JSON-based
APIs.
