=head1 NAME

Net::Duo::Object - Helper base class for Duo objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package Net::Duo::Admin::Token 1.00;

    use parent qw(Net::Duo::Object);

    sub fields {
        return {
            token_id => 'simple',
            type     => 'simple',
            serial   => 'simple',
            users    => 'Net::Duo::Admin::User',
        };
    }

    Net::Duo::Admin::Token->install_accessors;

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

Perl 5.14 or later and the modules HTTP::Request and HTTP::Response (part
of HTTP::Message), JSON, LWP (also known as libwww-perl), Perl6::Slurp,
Sub::Install, and URI::Escape (part of URI), all of which are available
from CPAN.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Duo API contains a variety of objects, represented as JSON objects
with multiple fields.  This objects often embed other objects inside them.
To provide a nice Perl API with getters, setters, and commit and delete
methods on individual objects, we want to wrap these Duo REST API objects
in Perl classes.

This module serves as a base class for such objects and does the dirty
work of constructing an object from decoded JSON data and building the
accessors automatically from a field specification.

This class should normally be considered an internal implementation detail
of the Net::Duo API.  Only developers of the Net::Duo modules should need
to worry about it.  Callers can use other Net::Duo API objects without
knowing anything about how this class works.

=head1 FIELD SPECIFICATION

Any class that wants to use Net::Duo::Object to construct itself must
provide a field specification.  This is a data structure that describes
all the data fields in that object.  It is used by the generic
Net::Duo::Object constructor to build the Perl data structure for an
object, and by the install_accessors() class method to create the
accessors for the class.

The client class must provide a class method named _fields() that returns
a reference to a hash.  The keys of the hash are the field names of the
data stored in an object of that class.  The values specify the type of
data stored in that field.  Each value may be either a simple string or a
reference to an array, in which case the first value is the type and the
remaining values are flags.  The types must be chosen from the following:

=over 4

=item C<array>

An array of simple text, number, or boolean values.

=item C<simple>

A simple text, number, or boolean field,

=item I<class>

The name of a class.  This field should then contain an array of zero or
more instances of that class, and the constructor for that class will be
called with the resulting structures.

=back

The flags must be chosen from the following:

=over 4

=item C<boolean>

This is a boolean field.  Convert all values to C<true> or C<false> before
sending the data to Duo.  Only makes sense with a field of type C<simple>.

=item C<set>

Generate a setter for this field.  install_accessors() will, in addition
to adding a method to retrieve the value, will add a method named after
the field but prefixed with C<set_> that will set the value of that field
and remember that it's been changed locally.  Changed fields will then
be pushed back to Duo via the commit() method.

=item C<zero_or_one>

This is a boolean field that wants values of 0 or 1.  Convert all values
to C<1> or C<0> before sending the data to Duo.  Only makes sense with a
field of type C<simple>.

=back

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=over 4

=item create(DUO, URI, DATA)

A general constructor for creating a new object in Duo.  Takes a Net::Duo
object, the URI of the REST endpoint for object creation, and a reference
to a hash of object data.  This method should be overridden by subclasses
to provide the URI and only expose the DUO and DATA arguments to the
caller.  Returns the newly-blessed object containing the data returned by
Duo.

=item install_accessors()

Using the field specification, creates accessor functions for each data
field that return copies of the data stored in that field, or undef if
there is no data.

=item new(DUO, DATA)

A general constructor for Net::Duo objects.  Takes a Net::Duo object and a
reference to a hash, which contains the data for an object of the class
being constructed.  Using the field specification for that class, the data
will be copied out of the object into a Perl data structure, converting
nested objects to other Net::Duo objects as required.

=back

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

=over 4

=item commit(URI)

A general method for committing changes to an object to Duo.  Takes the URI
of the REST endpoint for object modification.  This method should be
overridden by subclasses to provide the URI and only expose an
argument-less method.

After commit(), the internal representation of the object will be refreshed
to match the new data returned by the Duo API for that object.  Therefore,
other fields of the object may change after commit() if some other user has
changed other, unrelated fields in the object.

It's best to think of this method as a synchronize operation: changed data
is written back, overwriting what's in Duo, and unchanged data may be
overwritten by whatever is currently in Duo, if it is different.

=item json()

Convert the data stored in the object to JSON and return the results.  The
resulting JSON should match the JSON that one would get back from the Duo
web service when retrieving the same object (plus any changes made locally
to the object via set_*() methods).  This is primarily intended for
debugging dumps or for passing Duo objects to other systems via further
JSON APIs.
