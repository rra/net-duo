# Perl interface for the Duo Auth API.
#
# This Perl module collection provides a Perl interface to the Auth API
# integration for the Duo multifactor authentication service
# (https://www.duo.com/).  It differs from the Perl API sample code in that it
# wraps all the returned data structures in objects with method calls,
# abstracts some of the API details, and throws rich exceptions rather than
# requiring the caller deal with JSON data structures directly.

=head1 NAME

Net::Duo::Auth - Perl interface for the Duo Auth API

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $duo = Net::Duo::Auth->new({ key_file => '/path/to/keys.json' });
    my $timestamp = $duo->check;

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

Perl 5.14 or later and the modules HTTP::Request and HTTP::Response (part
of HTTP::Message), JSON, LWP (also known as libwww-perl), Perl6::Slurp,
Sub::Install, and URI::Escape (part of URI), all of which are available
from CPAN.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Net::Duo::Auth is an implementation of the Duo Auth REST API for Perl.
Method calls correspond to endpoints in the REST API.  Its goal is to
provide a native, natural interface for all Duo operations in the API from
inside Perl, while abstracting away as many details of the API as can be
reasonably handled automatically.

Currently, only a tiny number of available methods are implemented.

For calls that return complex data structures, the return from the call
will generally be an object in the Net::Duo::Auth namespace.  These
objects all have methods matching the name of the field in the Duo API
documentation that returns that field value.  Where it makes sense, there
will also be a method with the same name but with C<set_> prepended that
changes that value.  No changes are made to the Duo record itself until
the commit() method is called on the object, which will make the
underlying Duo API call to update the data.

On failure, all methods throw a Net::Duo::Exception object.  This can be
interpolated into a string for a simple error message, or inspected with
method calls for more details.  This is also true of all methods in all
objects in the Net::Duo namespace.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=over 4

=item new(ARGS)

Create a new Net::Duo::Auth object, which is used for all subsequent
calls.  This constructor is inherited from Net::Duo.  See L<Net::Duo> for
documentation of the possible arguments.

=back

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

=over 4

=item auth(ARGS)

Perform a Duo synchronous authentication.

The user will be authenticated given the factor and additional information
provided in ARGS.  The call will not return until the user has
authenticated or the call has failed for some reason.  To do long-polling
instead, see auth_async().

ARGS should be a reference to a hash.  The following keys may always be
present:

=over 4

=item user_id

The Duo ID of the user to authenticate.  Either this or C<username>, but
only one or the other, must be specified.

=item username

The username of the user to authenticate.  Either this or C<username>, but
only one or the other, must be specified.

=item factor

The authentication factor to use, chosen from C<push>, C<passcode>, or
C<phone>, or C<auto> to use whichever of C<push> or C<phone> appears best
for this user's devices according to Duo.  Required.

=item ipaddr

The IP address of the user, used for logging and to support sending an
C<allow> response without further verification if the user is coming from
a trusted network as configured in the integration.

=back

Additional keys may be present depending on C<factor>.  For a C<factor>
value of C<push>:

=over 4

=item device

The ID of the device to which to send the push notification, or C<auto> to
send to the first push-capable device.  Optional, defaulting to C<auto>.

=item type

This string is displayed in the Duo Mobile app before the word C<request>.
The default is C<Login>, so the phrase C<Login request> appears in the
push notification text and on the request details screen.  You may want to
specify C<Transaction>, C<Transfer>, etc.  Optional.

=item display_username

String to display in Duo Mobile in place of the user's Duo username.
Optional.

=item pushinfo

A reference to a list of additional key/value pairs to display to the user
as part of the authentication request.  For example:

    { pushinfo => [from => 'login portal', domain => 'example.com'] }

This is a list rather than a hash so that it preserves the order of
arguments, but there should always be an even number of members in the
list.

=back

For a C<factor> value of C<passcode>:

=over 4

=item passcode

The passcode to validate.  Required.

=back

For a C<factor> value of C<phone>:

=over 4

=item phone

The ID of the device to call, or C<auto> to call the first available
device.  Optional and defaults to C<auto>.

=back

In a scalar context, this method returns true if the user was successfully
authenticated and false if authentication failed for any reason.  In a
list context, the same status argument is returned as the first member of
the list, and the second member of the list will be a reference to a hash
of additional data.  Possible keys are:

=over 4

=item status

String detailing the progress or outcome of the authentication attempt.

=item status_msg

A string describing the result of the authentication attempt.  If the
authentication attempt was denied, it may identify a reason.  This string
is intended for display to the user.

=item trusted_device_token

If the trusted devices option is enabled for this account, returns a token
for a trusted device that can later be passed to the Duo C<preauth>
endpoint.

=back

If you are looking for the Duo C<sms> factor type, use the
send_sms_passcodes() method instead.

=item auth_async(ARGS)

Perform a Duo asynchronous authentication.

An authentication attempt will be started for a user according to the
information provided in ARGS.  The return value from this call will be a
Net::Duo::Admin::Async object, which provides a status() method, to get
the status of the authentication, and an id() method, to recover the
underlying transaction ID.  This approach allows the application to get
the authentication status at each stage, instead of receiving no
information until the authentication has succeeded or failed.

ARGS should be a reference to a hash with the same parameters as were
specified for the L</auth()> method.

=item check()

Calls the Duo C<check> endpoint.  This can be used as a simple check that
all of the integration arguments are correct and the client can
authenticate to the Duo authentication API.  On success, it returns the
current time on the Duo server in seconds since UNIX epoch.

=item send_sms_passcodes(USERNAME[, DEVICE])

Send a new batch of passcodes to the specified user via SMS.  By default,
the passcodes will be sent to the first SMS-capable device (the Duo
C<auto> behavior).  The optional second argument specifies a device ID to
which to send the passcodes.  Any failure will result in an exception.
