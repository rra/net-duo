=head1 NAME

Net::Duo::Mock::Agent - Mock LWP::UserAgent for Net::Duo testing

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Build the Net::Duo object and the mock.
    my %args = (key_file => 'admin.json');
    my $mock = Net::Duo::Mock::Agent->new(\%args);
    $args{user_agent} = $mock;
    my $duo = Net::Duo::Admin->new(\%args);

    # Indicate what to expect and then make the Net::Duo call.
    $mock->expect(
        {
            method        => 'GET',
            uri           => '/admin/v1/users',
            response_file => 'response.json',
        }
    );
    my @users = $duo->users;

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

Perl 5.14 or later and the modules HTTP::Request and HTTP::Response (part
of HTTP::Message), JSON, Perl6::Slurp, and URI::Escape (part of URI), all
of which are available from CPAN.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides the same interface as LWP::UserAgent, for the methods
that Net::Duo calls, and verifies that the information passed in by Duo is
correct.  It can also simulate responses to exercise response handling in
Net::Duo.  To test Net::Duo, pass a Test::Mock::Duo::Agent object to the
constructor of a Net::Duo-based class as the user_agent argument.

All tests are reported by Test::More, and no effort is made to produce a
predictable number of test results.  This means that any calling test
program should probably not specify a plan and instead use done_testing().

This module is primarily used by the Net::Duo test suite and can be
ignored entirely when using Net::Duo normally.  It is provided as part of
the Net::Duo module install, instead of kept only in the distribution
source tree, because it may be useful for the test suites of other Perl
modules or programs that use Net::Duo internally and want to test that
integration without network access or a live Duo account to point to.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=over 4

=item new(ARGS)

Create a new Net::Duo::Mock::Agent object.  ARGS should be the same data
structure passed to the Net::Duo-derived constructor (with the obvious
exception of the user_agent argument, which is ignored).

=back

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

=over 4

=item expect(ARGS)

Expect a REST API call from Net::Duo.  This method can be called multiple
times to build up a queue of expected requests.

ARGS is used to specify both the expected request data and the response
to return to the caller.  The same response is returned regardless of
whether the request is correct.

There are two ways to specify the response: a complete HTTP::Response
object, or the JSON data of the response.  If only the JSON data is
specified, the request will return a response with a status code of 200
and a Duo success result (C<stat> of C<OK>), with the supplied JSON data
as the C<response> key in the JSON response data.  The content will have
a Content-Type of C<application/json>.

ARGS should be a reference to a hash with keys selected from the
following:

=over 4

=item method

The expected method of the request.

=item uri

The expected URI of the request.  This should just be the path, not the
hostname or protocol portions of the full URL, and should not include any
GET parameters.

=item content

The expected content of the request.  This is the parameters in the URL
if the method is GET and the expected C<application/x-www-form-urlencoded>
content of the request for any other request type.  It may be empty or not
specified if the request should not contain any additional parameters.

=item response

An HTTP::Response object to return to the client.  This object is always
returned without modification to any request, even if it doesn't match the
expected request.

=item response_data

A data structure that will be converted to JSON and included as the value
of the C<response> key in the returned success response to the client.

=item response_file

A file containing JSON that will be included as the value of the
C<response> key in the returned success response to the client.

=item next_offset

Return paging metadata in the response, setting the C<next_offset> key to
this value, the C<prev_offset> key to 0, and the C<total_objects> key to
the value of the I<total_objects> parameter, which must be specified as
well.  Set this to C<undef> to include pagination information but without
a C<next_offset> key.

=item total_objects

Value to return in the C<total_objects> key in the paging metadata.

=back

=item request(REQUEST)

This is the interface called internally by Net::Duo to make an API call.
The interface is the same as the request() method of LWP::UserAgent:
REQUEST is an HTTP::Request object, and Net::Duo::Mock::Agent will return
an HTTP::Response object.  Currently, this is the only LWP::UserAgent
method implemented by this mock, since it's the only one that Net::Duo
uses.

When request() is called, it checks the content of the request against
whatever the mock was told to expect via the expect() method.  The results
of that comparison are reported via Test::More functions.  The expected
call is then cleared.  This means that expect() must be called between
each call to a Net::Duo method that would result in a REST API call
request.

If request() is called when no request was expected (via an expect() call),
it throws an exception.
