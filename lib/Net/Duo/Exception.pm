=head1 NAME

Net::Duo::Exception - Rich exception object for Net::Duo failures

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use 5.010;

    # Use by a caller of the Net::Duo API.
    my $duo = Net::Duo->new({ key_file => '/path/to/keys.json' });
    if (!eval { $duo->check() }) {
        my $e = $@;
        say 'Code: ', $e->code();
        say 'Message: ', $e->message();
        say 'Detail: ', $e->detail();
        print "\nFull reply content:\n", $e->content();
    }

    # Use internally by Net::Duo objects.
    die Net::Duo::Exception->propagate($@);
    die Net::Duo::Exception->internal('some error message');
    my $response = some_http_call();
    die Net::Duo::Exception->http($response);
    my $reply = some_duo_call();
    die Net::Duo::Exception->protocol('error message', $reply);
    die Net::Duo::Exception->api($reply);

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

Perl 5.14 or later and the module HTTP::Message, which is available from
CPAN.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Net::Duo::Exception is a rich representation of errors from any Net::Duo
API.  All Net::Duo APIs throw Net::Duo::Exception objects on any failure,
including internal errors, protocol errors, HTTP errors, and failures
returned by the Duo API.  This object carries all available details about
the failure and can be inspected by the caller to recover additional
information.  If the caller doesn't care about the details, it provides a
stringification that is suitable for simple error messages.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

All class methods are constructors.  These are primarily for the internal
use of Net::Duo classes to generate the exception and will normally not be
called by users of Net::Duo.  Each correspond to a type of error and tell
Net::Duo::Exception what data to extract to flesh out the exception
object.

=over 4

=item api(OBJECT, CONTENT)

Creates an exception for a Duo API failure.  OBJECT should be the JSON
object (decoded as a hash) returned by the Duo API call, and CONTENT
should be the undecoded text.  This exception constructor should be used
whenever possible, since it provides the most useful information.

=item http(RESPONSE)

Creates an exception from an HTTP::Response object, RESPONSE.  This
exception constructor should be used for calls that fail at the HTTP
protocol level without getting far enough to return JSON.

=item internal(MESSAGE)

Creates an exception for some internal failure that doesn't involve an
HTTP request to the Duo API.  In this case, the code will always be set
to 50000: the normal 500 code for an internal server error plus the two
additional digits Duo normally adds to the code.

=item propagate(EXCEPTION)

Very similar to internal(), except that the argument is assumed to be
another exception.  The resulting error message will be cleaned of
uninteresting location information before being passed to internal().

=item protocol(MESSAGE, REPLY)

Creates an exception for a protocol failure.  This should be used when
a call returns unexpected or malformated data, such as invalid JSON or
JSON with missing data fields.  MESSAGE should be an informative error
message, and REPLY should be the content of the unparsable reply.

=back

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

These are the methods most commonly called by programs that use the
Net::Duo module.  They return various information from the exception.

=over 4

=item code()

Returns the Duo error code for this error, or 50000 for internally
generated errors.  The Duo code is conventionally an HTTP code followed
by two additional digits to create a unique error code.

=item content()

The full content of the reply from the Duo API that triggered the error.
This is not included in the default string error message, but may be
interesting when debugging problems.

=item detail()

Any additional (generally short) detail that might clarify the error
message.  This corresponds to the C<message_detail> key in the Duo
error response.

=item message()

The error message.

=item spaceship([STRING], [SWAP])

This method is called if the exception object is compared to a string via
cmp.  It will compare the given string to the verbose error message and
return the result.  If SWAP is set, it will reverse the order to compare
the given string to the verbose error.  (This is the normal interface
contract for an overloaded C<cmp> implementation.)

=item to_string()

This method is called if the exception is interpolated into a string.  It
can also be called directly to retrieve the default string form of the
exception.
