# Perl interface for the Duo Admin API.
#
# This Perl module collection provides a Perl interface to the Admin API
# integration for the Duo multifactor authentication service
# (https://www.duo.com/).  It differs from the Perl API sample code in that it
# wraps all the returned data structures in objects with method calls,
# abstracts some of the API details, and throws rich exceptions rather than
# requiring the caller deal with JSON data structures directly.

=head1 NAME

Net::Duo::Admin - Perl interface for the Duo Admin API

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $duo = Net::Duo::Admin->new({ key_file => '/path/to/keys.json' });
    my @users = $duo->users;

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

Perl 5.14 or later and the modules HTTP::Request and HTTP::Response (part
of HTTP::Message), JSON, LWP (also known as libwww-perl), Perl6::Slurp,
Sub::Install, and URI::Escape (part of URI), all of which are available
from CPAN.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Net::Duo::Admin is an implementation of the Duo Admin REST API for Perl.
Method calls correspond to endpoints in the REST API.  Its goal is to
provide a native, natural interface for all Duo operations in the API from
inside Perl, while abstracting away as many details of the API as can be
reasonably handled automatically.

Currently, only a tiny number of available methods are implemented.

For calls that return complex data structures, the return from the call
will generally be an object in the Net::Duo::Admin namespace.  These
objects all have methods matching the name of the field in the Duo API
documentation that returns that field value.  Where it makes sense, there
will also be a method with the same name but with C<set_> prepended that
changes that value.  No changes are made to the Duo record itself until
the commit() method is called on the object, which will make the
underlying Duo API call to update the data.

Some objects have associated lists of other objects.  For example, a user
has a list of phones and a list of tokens.  Wherever this pattern occurs,
new objects can be added to that list with a method starting with C<add_>
and removed with a method starting with C<remove_>.  These changes are
pushed to Duo immediately and do not wait for the next commit().

On failure, all methods throw a Net::Duo::Exception object.  This can be
interpolated into a string for a simple error message, or inspected with
method calls for more details.  This is also true of all methods in all
objects in the Net::Duo namespace.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=over 4

=item new(ARGS)

Create a new Net::Duo::Admin object, which is used for all subsequent
calls.  This constructor is inherited from Net::Duo.  See L<Net::Duo> for
documentation of the possible arguments.

=back

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

=over 4

=item integrations()

Retrieves all the integrations currently present in this Duo account and
returns them as a list of Net::Duo::Admin::Integration objects.  Be aware
that this list may be quite long if the Duo account supports many
integrations, and the entire list is read into memory.

=item logs_administrator([MINTIME])

Returns a list of administrative actions.  Each member of this list will
be a reference to a hash with the following keys:

=over 4

=item timestamp

The time of the event in seconds since UNIX epoch.

=item username

The username of the administrator, or C<API> if the action was performed
via the Admin API.

=item action

The administrator action.  See the Duo Admin API documentation for a full
list of valid values.

=item object

An identifier for the object that was acted on.  What fields are used as
an identifier will vary by type of object.

=item description

The details of what was changed.

=back

At most 1,000 log entries will be returned.  If MINTIME is provided, only
records with a time stamp after MINTIME will be returned.  All records can
therefore be retrieved by calling this method repeatedly, first with no
MINTIME and then with MINTIME matching the timestamp of the last returned
record from the previous call.

=item logs_authentication([MINTIME])

Returns a list of authentication attempts.  Each member of the list will
be a reference to a hash with the following keys:

=over 4

=item timestamp

The time of the event in seconds since UNIX epoch.

=item username

The authenticating user's username.

=item factor

The authentication factor, chosen from C<phone call>, C<passcode>,
C<bypass code>, C<sms passcode>, C<sms refresh>, or C<duo push>.

=item result

The result of the authentication, chosen from C<success>, C<failure>,
C<error>, or C<fraud>.

=item ip

The IP address from which the authentication attempt originated.

=item integration

The name of the integration from which the authentication attempt
originated.

=back

At most 1,000 authentication log entries will be returned.  If MINTIME is
provided, only records with a time stamp after MINTIME will be returned.
All records can therefore be retrieved by calling this method repeatedly,
first with no MINTIME and then with MINTIME matching the timestamp of the
last returned record from the previous call.

=item logs_telephony([MINTIME])

Returns a list of telephony events.  Each member of this list will be a
reference to a hash with the following keys:

=over 4

=item timestamp

The time of the event in seconds since UNIX epoch.

=item context

How this telephony event was initiated.  This will be one of
C<administrator login>, C<authentication>, C<enrollment>, or C<verify>.

=item type

The event type.  One of C<sms> or C<phone>.

=item phone

The phone number that initiated this event.

=item credits

How many telephony credits this event cost.

=back

At most 1,000 log entries will be returned.  If MINTIME is provided, only
records with a time stamp after MINTIME will be returned.  All records can
therefore be retrieved by calling this method repeatedly, first with no
MINTIME and then with MINTIME matching the timestamp of the last returned
record from the previous call.

=item user(USERNAME)

Retrieves a single user by username and returns it as a
Net::Duo::Admin::User object if found.  If no user with that username
exists, returns undef, and does not throw an exception.

=item users()

Retrieves all the users currently present in this Duo account and returns
them as a list of Net::Duo::Admin::User objects.  Be aware that this list
may be quite long and consume a lot of resources for accounts with many
users.
