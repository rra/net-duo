=head1 NAME

Net::Duo::Auth::Async - Representation of an asynchronous Duo authentication

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use 5.010;

    my $config = get_config();
    my $duo = Net::Duo::Auth->new($config);
    my $async = $duo->auth_async({ username => 'user', factor => 'auto' });
    say scalar($async->status);

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

Perl 5.14 or later and the modules HTTP::Request and HTTP::Response (part
of HTTP::Message), JSON, LWP (also known as libwww-perl), Perl6::Slurp,
Sub::Install, and URI::Escape (part of URI), all of which are available
from CPAN.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Net::Duo::Auth::Async represents an open asynchronous authentication
attempt with Duo.  It's a wrapper around the Duo async transaction ID and
the method to check on the status of that transaction.  This object can
either be created directly from a stored transaction ID or is returned by
the auth_async() method of Net::Duo::Auth.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=over 4

=item new(DUO, ID)

Create a new Net::Duo::Auth::Async object from a Net::Duo object and a
transaction.  This should be used to recreate the Net::Duo::Auth::Async
object if the transaction ID were handed off to some other process that
then asks for status later.

=back

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

=over 4

=item id()

Returns the transaction ID represented by this object.  This transaction
ID can be used later to recreate the object.

=item status()

Returns the status of the authentication.

In scalar context, returns only the status, which will be one of C<allow>,
C<deny>, and C<waiting>.  C<waiting> indicates that the authentication is
still in progress and has not yet completed.

In list context, returns the same status as the first element and a
reference to a hash of additional information as the second element.  The
hash will have one or more of the following keys:

=over 4

=item status

String detailing the progress or outcome of the authentication attempt.
See the Duo Auth API documentation for a complete list of possible values.

=item status_msg

A string describing the result of the authentication attempt.  If the
authentication attempt was denied, it may identify a reason.  This string
is intended for display to the user.

=item trusted_device_token

If the trusted devices option is enabled for this account, returns a token
for a trusted device that can later be passed to the Duo C<preauth>
endpoint.
