# Perl interface for the Duo multifactor authentication service.
#
# This Perl module collection provides a Perl interface to the Duo multifactor
# authentication service (https://www.duo.com/).  It differs from the Perl API
# sample code in that it abstracts some of the API details and throws rich
# exceptions rather than requiring the caller deal with JSON data structures
# directly.
#
# This module is intended primarily for use as a base class for more
# specialized Perl modules implementing the specific Duo APIs, but it can also
# be used directly to make generic API calls.

=head1 NAME

Net::Duo - API for Duo multifactor authentication service

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $duo = Net::Duo->new({ key_file => '/path/to/keys.json' });
    my $reply = $duo->call_json('GET', '/auth/v2/check');

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

Perl 5.14 or later and the modules HTTP::Request and HTTP::Response (part
of HTTP::Message), JSON, LWP (also known as libwww-perl), Perl6::Slurp,
and URI::Escape (part of URI), all of which are available from CPAN.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Net::Duo provides an object-oriented Perl interface for generic calls to
one of the the Duo Security REST APIs.  This module is intended primarily
for use as a base class for more specialized Perl modules implementing the
specific Duo APIs, but it can also be used directly to make generic API
calls.

On failure, all methods throw a Net::Duo::Exception object.  This can be
interpolated into a string for a simple error message, or inspected with
method calls for more details.  This is also true of all methods in all
objects in the Net::Duo namespace.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=over 4

=item new(ARGS)

Create a new Net::Duo object.  This should be used for all subsequent API
calls.  ARGS should be a hash reference with one or more of the following
keys:

=over 4

=item api_hostname

The API hostname returned by Duo when the API integration was created.

This key is required if C<key_file> is not set.

=item integration_key

The integration key returned by Duo when the API integration was created.
This is effectively the public "username" for this integration.

This key is required if C<key_file> is not set.

=item key_file

The path to a file in JSON format that contains the key and hostname data
for a Duo integration.  This file should contain one JSON object with keys
C<integration_key>, C<secret_key>, and C<api_hostname>.  These are the
three data values that are returned when one creates a new Duo API
integration.

Be aware that the C<secret_key> value in this file is security-sensitive
information equivalent to a password.  Anyone in possession of that key
has complete control of all data and actions to which the integration has
access.

Either this key or all of C<integration_key>, C<secret_key>, and
C<api_hostname> must be provided.  If both this key and some of those
keys are provided, their values will override the values retrieved from
the C<key_file> file.

=item secret_key

The secret key returned by Duo when the API integration was created.  This
is security-sensitive information equivalent to a password.  Anyone in
possession of that key has complete control of all data and actions to
which the integration has access.  Do not hard-code this into programs;
instead, read it from a file with appropriate permissions or retrieve it
via some other secure mechanism.

This key is required if C<key_file> is not set.

=item user_agent

The user agent to use for all requests.  This should be a Perl object that
supports the same API as LWP::UserAgent.

Normally, the caller will not provide this key, in which case Net::Duo will
create an LWP::UserAgent object internally to use to make Duo API calls.
This argument is provided primarily so that the user agent can be overridden
for unit testing.

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

=over 4

=item call(METHOD, PATH[, ARGS])

Make a generic Duo API call, with no assumptions about the response.

This is a low-level escape hatch to make any Duo API call that this module
does not know about, regardless of what format in which it returns its
results.  The caller will have to provide all of the details (HTTP method,
URL path, and all arguments as a reference to a hash of key/value pairs).
The URL path must start with a slash.

The return value is the resulting HTTP::Response object from the web API
call.  No error checking will be performed.  The caller is responsible for
examining the HTTP::Response object for any problems, including internal
or HTTP errors.

Most Duo API calls return structured JSON and follow a standard pattern
for indicating errors.  For those calls, use call_json() instead of this
method.  call() is needed only for the small handful of API calls that do
not return JSON in that format, such as the Auth API C</logo> endpoint.

=item call_json(METHOD, PATH[, ARGS])

Make a generic Duo API call that returns a JSON response.

This is the escape hatch to use to make any Duo API call that this module
does not know about.  The caller will have to provide all of the details
(HTTP method, URL path, and all arguments as a reference to a hash of
key/value pairs).  The URL path must start with a slash.

The return value will be only the value of the response key from the
returned JSON.  This method still handles checking the C<stat> value from
Duo and throwing a Net::Duo::Exception object on call failure.

This method cannot be used with the small handful of API calls that do not
return JSON, such as the Auth API C</logo> endpoint.

=item call_json_paged(METHOD, PATH[, ARGS])

The same as call_json(), except for endpoints that require pagination.
This will make repeated calls to call_json() with increasing offsets until
it has retrieved all of the objects, and then return them all as a single
response.  It always uses a C<limit> setting of 500.
