BLURB

  Net::Duo provides an object-oriented Perl interface for the Duo Security
  REST APIs.  It attempts to abstract some of the API details and provide
  an object-oriented view of the returned objects in order to make use of
  the API in Perl code more natural than dealing with JSON data structures
  directly.  Currently, some parts of the Auth and Admin APIs are
  implemented alongside with generic methods to call any of the JSON-based
  APIs.

DESCRIPTION

  Duo Security is a cloud second-factor authentication service that
  supports a wide variety of different mechanisms for a user to establish
  a second authentication factor.  It is intended to supplement local
  authentication systems, such as password-based authentication, with an
  unrelated second factor: possession of a device, or access to a phone.
  Duo Security provides direct integration with a variety of applications
  and a self-service web sign-up interface, but for more control, it also
  provides several RESTful APIs that can perform all possible actions on
  Duo accounts, users, and their devices.

  This module implements a client for the Duo REST APIs.  It differs from
  the sample Perl implementation provided by Duo in that it attempts to
  wrap the Duo data model and JSON information in Perl objects and provide
  logical and convenient methods on those objects to make writing Perl
  clients of Duo simpler and easier.  It tries to abstract portions of the
  API, such as the endpoint URLs, that allow for more natural and less
  cluttered Perl code than manipulating the JSON data structures directly.

  The API implementation is currently incomplete and contains just the
  calls required by Stanford's integration.  Only the Auth and Admin APIs
  are implemented, and both are partial.  However, the Net::Duo call and
  call_json methods can be used to make calls to APIs that aren't fully
  implemented.

REQUIREMENTS

  Perl 5.14 or later and Module::Build 0.28 or later are required to build
  this module.  The following additional Perl modules are required to use
  it:

      JSON
      HTTP::Message
      LWP::UserAgent 6.00 or later (part of libwww-perl)
      Perl6::Slurp
      Sub::Install
      URI::Escape (part of URI)

  The following additional Perl modules will be used by the test suite if
  present:

      Test::MinimumVersion
      Test::Perl::Critic
      Test::Pod
      Test::Pod::Coverage
      Test::Spelling
      Test::Strict
      Test::Synopsis

  All are available on CPAN.  Those tests will be skipped if the modules
  are not available.

  To enable tests that don't detect functionality problems but are used to
  sanity-check the release, set the environment variable RELEASE_TESTING
  to a true value.  To enable tests that may be sensitive to the local
  environment or that produce a lot of false positives without uncovering
  many problems, set the environment variable AUTHOR_TESTING to a true
  value.

BUILDING AND INSTALLATION

  Net::Duo uses Module::Build and can be installed using the same process
  as any other Module::Build module:

      perl Build.PL
      ./Build
      ./Build test
      ./Build install

  You will have to run the last command as root unless you're installing
  into a local Perl module tree in your home directory.
